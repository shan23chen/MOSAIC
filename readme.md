SAE as features -> explainable classifier

finished VLLM/LLM loading and extract all hidden given layer

then map to SAE and get features

Can store both activations and SAE, but do not save all SAE because they are expensive to store

TODO next week -> connect them to classifiers, look into classifier visualizations
