Please add `patch_size` and `vision_feature_select_strategy` to the model's processing config or set directly with `processor.patch_size = {{patch_size}}` and processor.vision_feature_select_strategy = {{vision_feature_select_strategy}}`. Using processors without these attributes in the config is deprecated and will throw an error in v4.47.

Please add `patch_size` and `vision_feature_select_strategy` to the model's processing config or set directly with `processor.patch_size = {{patch_size}}` and processor.vision_feature_select_strategy = {{vision_feature_select_strategy}}`. Using processors without these attributes in the config is deprecated and will throw an error in v4.47.
Starting from v4.46, the `logits` model output will have the same type as the model (except at train time, where it will always be FP32)
From v4.47 onwards, when a model cache is to be returned, `generate` will return a `Cache` instance instead by default (as opposed to the legacy tuple of tuples format). If you want to keep returning the legacy format, please set `return_legacy_cache=True`.
